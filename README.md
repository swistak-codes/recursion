Code for blog article <https://swistak.codes/rekurencja-co-to-jest/> about recursion and https://swistak.codes/derekursywacja/ about moving from recursion to iteration.

* basic-example.c - Fibonacci and factorial written purely recursive in C
* basic-example.fs - Fibonacci and factorial written purely recursive in F#
* tail-example.c - Fibonacci and factorial written with tail recursion in C
* tail-example.fs - Fibonacci and factorial written with tail recursion in F#
* iteration-from-tail.c - example showing Fibonacci and factorial rewritten to iterative directly from their tail recursive version (C)
* nonrecursive-stack.c - example showing Fibonacci and factorial rewritten to iterative by simulating call stack (C)
* benchmark.c - program for measuring execution times of different ways of writing Fibonacci function
